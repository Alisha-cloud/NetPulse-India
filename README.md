# 🌐 NetPulse India  
**Tracking Internet Shutdowns and Throttling Across India in Real Time**

> _A real-time civic-tech platform that detects, visualizes, and analyzes internet disruptions to empower citizens, journalists, and policymakers with data transparency._

---

## 🚀 Overview

Every internet shutdown tells a story — of disconnected students, halted businesses, and silenced voices.  
**NetPulse India** bridges that gap by combining **citizen reporting, AI analytics, and real-time mapping** to bring visibility to network disruptions nationwide.

Our platform collects reports from users, verifies them through crowdsourcing and official sources, and visualizes their social and economic impact across India.
